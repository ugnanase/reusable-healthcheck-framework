# Reusable Integration Health Check Framework using IIB

Description:
The framework mainly developed to help the Integration development or SOA testing team to prioritize the work based on the back-end service availability. Apparently, the front-end applications always connect the integration layer to connect its backend or any other partner systems by webservice. The framework tests all the integrated services and provide a detailed excel report of each service working status by Email to the stakeholder before starting the work. Also, it sends SMS alerts to the application team if any one of the application or services not working. This framework helps the project team to increase the productivity.      

Features:
There are many key features available in the framework and some of them listed here to understand about the developed framework. 
1.	It solves a common problem of back end service availability to the front-end applications.
2.	A generic framework can be reused in any integration project
3.	It reduces the involved stake holders time & effort and they can focus on other critical work. Reduce or eliminate the manual testing effort to understand the back-end service status.
4.	You can limit how many services can be tested by changing the input configuration.
5.	Email report facility to the stakeholders for pre planning of BAU activities.

Advantages of the Framework:
1.	The framework increases the reliability of your application and reduces the programming and testing effort. Since the framework has been prebuilt and tested in the client environment.
2.	Framework can be upgraded by its creators, which could potentially provide new functionality, improved performance or increased stability with additional programming from your side as framework user.  
3.	Well written framework provides you to easily add more services to check its availability.
